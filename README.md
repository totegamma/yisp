**YISP** (suggested pronunciation: `/ËˆjÉªsp/`) is a lightweight evaluation engine for YAML, inspired by Lisp.  
It allows you to embed logic, expressions, and includes within YAML files.  
This is useful for generating structured configuration such as Kubernetes manifests, Ansible playbooks, and more.

## Installation

```sh
go install github.com/totegamma/yisp@latest
```

## Syntax

Unlike traditional Lisp, where **everything is code** and you need to quote values to treat them as data,  
**yisp takes the opposite approach**: everything is treated as plain YAML data **by default**,  
and only expressions explicitly tagged with `!yisp` will be evaluated as code.

This allows you to embed small, functional logic in otherwise standard YAML documentsâ€”making it easy to integrate with existing tools.

### simple example:

hello_world.yaml
```yaml
mystring: !yisp
  - concat
  - hello
  - ' '
  - world
```

build:
```sh
yisp build hello_world.yaml
```

result:
```yaml
mystring: hello world
```

### Handling multiple documents:

```yaml
!yisp
- include
- "./manifest1.yaml"
- "./manifest2.yaml"
```

such as:
manifest1.yaml:
```yaml 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
```
manifest2.yaml:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myservice
```

results:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myservice
```

### Define a function:

```yaml
!yisp &mkpod
- lambda 
- [!string name, !string image]
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: *name
  spec:
    containers:
      - name: *name
        image: *image
---
!yisp
- *mkpod
- mypod1
- myimage1

---
!yisp
- *mkpod
- mypod2
- myimage2
```

results:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod1
spec:
  containers:
    - name: mypod1
      image: myimage1
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod2
spec:
  containers:
    - name: mypod2
      image: myimage2
```

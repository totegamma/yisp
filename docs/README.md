## What is YISP?

YISP (pronounced `/ˈjɪsp/`) is a tool that allows you to embed logic, expressions, and includes within YAML files. This is particularly useful for generating structured configuration such as Kubernetes manifests, Ansible playbooks, and more.

By combining the simplicity of YAML with the power of Lisp-like expressions, YISP enables you to create dynamic, reusable configuration templates that can adapt to different environments and requirements.

## Project Status

YISP is currently under active development. Interfaces and features may change without notice. Use with caution in production environments.
